To work with custom annotations using AOP...

Two types of custom annotations
1. field level (DBField.java)
2. method level (TrackExecutionTime.java)

Configured AOP in 3 ways:
1. using java configuration file 
   For configuration: CustomConfig.java
   For AOP logic: ExecTimeAspect.java (advice methods WITH annotations)

   Execute lines 17 through 54 in CustomdemoApplication.java

2. using xml configuration file (manual mapping)
   For configuration: config.xml in resources
   For AOP logic: ExecTimeAspectXml.java (advice methods WITHOUT annotations)

   Execute lines 58 through 74 (excluding 63) in CustomdemoApplication.java
   
3. using xml configuration file (auto mapping with the annotations)
   For configuration: autoconfig.xml in resources
   For AOP logic: ExecTimeAspect.java (advice methods WITH annotations)

   Execute lines 58 through 74 (excluding 61) in CustomdemoApplication.java

Custom Annotation's implementation: User.java (implemented both Field-level and Method-level)
